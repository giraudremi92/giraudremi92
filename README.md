# Hey there 👋

I'm a **Lead Backend Developer & Cloud Architect**,🇲🇨 specializing in building scalable AI systems and cloud-native solutions on AWS.

Currently in R&D to become a Principal AI Engineer — exploring the cutting edge of agentic AI, sovereign systems, and production-grade ML infrastructure.

## What I'm Working On 🚀

**Building [Alki.io](https://alki.io)** — A modern **MLOps data pipeline for AI-powered forecasting**, where machine learning models predict, optimize, and drive real-time business decisions. End-to-end data orchestration from ingestion to inference.

Currently laser-focused on:
- 🤖 **Agentic AI & LLM Orchestration** — LangChain & LangFuse for building intelligent, observable AI agents
- 🔧 **LLM Fine-tuning** — Working with Gemma 3 and other open-source models to build specialized systems
- 🏛️ **Sovereign AI & Small Language Models (SLMs)** — Building with open-source, on-premise solutions that respect data sovereignty
- 💻 **Local ML Infrastructure** — Running everything on ASUS GB10 (DGX Spark) — no cloud dependencies, full control

## My Stack 🛠️

- **Backend**: Building high-performance APIs
- **Cloud**: AWS (architect-level expertise), infrastructure automation
- **AI/ML**: 
  - MLOps pipelines with Apache Airflow
  - LangChain & LangFuse for agentic workflows
  - Model fine-tuning and optimization
  - Small Language Models & sovereign AI frameworks
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, observability best practices
- **Hardware**: **ASUS GB10 (DGX Spark)** for local, on-premise ML workloads 🟢
- **Open Source AI**: NVIDIA Certified, Nemotron LLM & Mistral, Gemma 3, LangGraph Certified.
- LLM : Claude, Claude Code
- ...

## Philosophy 🧠

Passionate about **sovereign AI** and the shift toward smaller, more efficient language models that can run locally without cloud dependency. Building systems that are transparent, compliant, and maintainable — because not all problems need billion-parameter models.

## Open Source Contributions 🌟

Active in the open-source AI space around:
- Agentic AI frameworks (LangChain ecosystem)
- LLM fine-tuning & optimization

## Beyond Code 🎮
